# eventemitter9
:fire: The one and only event emitter :fire:

## Background
Thanks to the awesome 
[workshop on CQRS, Event-Sourcing and DDD](https://software-architecture-summit.de/domain-driven-design/cqrs-event-sourcing-und-ddd-theorie-und-praxis-teil-1/) 
at the Software Architecture Summit 2019 in Berlin and especially for making great points about the rapidly evolving 
javascript userland libraries from [Golo Roden](https://github.com/goloroden) of 
[thenativeweb.io](https://www.thenativeweb.io/#who-we-are), there just **HAD TO BE** another eventemitter package, so he 
will hopefully find it on his next talk.

## FAQ
### Why not eventemitter[1-8]?
I do not discriminate against those, they are perfectly viable packages, the more the better!

### Is this a joke?
Yes, absolutely, it is merely to make a point of the quickly evolving package community.

### Are you Golo yourself?
No, I am not, feel free to [reach out to me](https://github.com/ArSn) if you have any concerns about this package. 
I am just trying to give out some kudos here.
